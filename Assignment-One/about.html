            <h2>CPSC 455: Assignment 1</h2>
            <p>As a student in UBC CPSC 455 during the Summer of 2024, I have created a team builder website for Assignment 1. 
                The purpose of this website is to utilize Vanilla JS, HTML, and CSS which we covered in Workshop 1.
            </p>
            <p>
                Students can register a member into a team, read about other members, and remove individual members.
                Additionally, the website is designed to be responsive across most devices as tested in Chrome's developer tools.
            </p>
