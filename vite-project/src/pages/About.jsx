          <h3>CPSC 455: Assignment 2</h3>
          <p>
            As a student in UBC CPSC 455 during the Summer of 2024, I have created a team builder website for Assignment 1.
            The purpose of this website is to utilize Vanilla JS, HTML, and CSS which we covered in Workshop 1.
          </p>
          <p>
            Students can register a member into a team, read about other members, and remove individual members.
            Additionally, the website is designed to be responsive across most devices as tested in Chrome's developer tools.
          </p>
        </div>
      </>
