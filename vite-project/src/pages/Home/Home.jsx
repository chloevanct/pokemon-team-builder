// Search and Dialog design inspired by ChatGPT 4.0 and Google Search on June 1-2 2024
// Prompts used were â€œHelp me get started on adding search functionality/dialog with react-redux"
// The generated code was adopted: overall code structure
// Dialog design: keep is simple, manage locally, state doesn't need global accessibility
// Search functionality: helps with scalability (other filters, pagination)
